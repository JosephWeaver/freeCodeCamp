					<div class="caption text-center">He's called &quot;The King&quot; for a reason. Richard Petty has <em>by far</em> the most career wins (200) and is tied for the most NASCAR championship cup wins (7). He raced in over 1,000 races throughout his 35-year career, and it's very likely that nobody will ever touch his record of 200 wins.<br><br>I've been a fan of his for 21 years now, as of 2017. He's my sports hero.</div>

					<h3 class="text-center">A timeline of Richard Petty's life:</h3>
					<ul class="timeline">
						<li><strong>1937</strong> - Born in Level Cross, North Carolina</li>
						<li><strong>1958</strong> - Began his NASCAR career on July 18, 16 days after his 21st birthday.</li>
						<li><strong>1959</strong> - Named NASCAR Rookie of the Year, after he produced 9 top 10 finishes, including six Top 5 finishes.</li>
						<li><strong>1960</strong> - Finished 2nd in the NASCAR Grand National Points Race, and got his first career win at the Charlotte Fairfrounds Speedway.</li>
						<li><strong>1963</strong> - Petty's breakout year, which included wins at tracks like Martinsville and Bridgehampton.</li>
						<li><strong>1964</strong> - While driving a potent Plymouth with a new Hemi engine, Petty led 184 of the 200 laps to capture his first Daytona 500, en route to 9 victories, earning over $114,000 and his first Grand National championship. Petty and Chrysler’s new 426 Hemi so dominated the 1964 NASCAR season that NASCAR owner Bill France outlawed the engine for 1965. Rather than switching brands&mdash;or engines&mdash;Petty decided to forego racing NASCAR for the season. Instead, Petty Enterprises installed the Hemi in the new compact Barracuda for drag racing. The car carried the name &quot;Outlawed&quot; on the doors in reference to NASCAR’s treatment of the Hemi.</li>
						<li><strong>1965</strong> - Spent much of the year competing as a drag racer. Tragically, during a match race with Arnie Beswick, a broken front suspension sent the Barracuda into a crowd of spectators, killing an 8-year-old boy and injuring eight others. Devastated, Petty ordered the remains of the Outlawed car buried on his property, so he (or anyone else) would never have to see it again. Petty suffered light injuries in the violent crash, but the shock of the young boy's death stayed with him for years. &quot;Nothing in my whole life has ever gotten to me like that,&quot; Petty wrote later. &quot;I couldn't stand to think about it. I tried drag racing again, but my heart wasn't in it. I kept thinking about the boy, so I quit.&quot;</li>
						<li><strong>1966</strong> - Back in NASCAR again, Petty was able to overcome a 2-lap deficit to win his second Daytona 500 when the race was stopped on lap 198 of 200 because of a thunderstorm. This made him the first driver to win the event twice.</li>
						<li><strong>1967</strong> - This was a milestone year for Petty, in which he won 27 of the 48 races he entered, including a record 10 wins in a row (between August 12 and October 1). He won his second Grand National Championship. One of the 27 victories was the Southern 500 at Darlington, which would be his only Southern 500 victory. His dominance in this season earned him the nickname &quot;King Richard.&quot;<br><br>Also in 1967, Petty appeared in the Elvis Presley movie <em>Speedway</em> that was shot and filmed at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. This movie was released in 1968.</li>
						<li><strong>1969</strong> - Petty switched brands to Ford, due to his belief the Plymouth was not competitive on super-speedways; he wanted a slippery Dodge Daytona but Chrysler executives insisted he stay with Plymouth. He would win 10 races and finish second in points.</li>
						<li><strong>1970</strong> - Petty returned to Plymouth for the season, so he could race in its sleek new Superbird with shark nose and towel rack wing. This is the car in which Petty is cast in the Pixar film <em>Cars</em>.<br><br>In the Rebel 400 at Darlington, Petty was injured when his Plymouth Road Runner cut a tire and slammed hard into the wall separating the track from the pit area. The car flipped several times before coming to rest on its side. This accident injured Petty's shoulder, and helped Bobby Isaac to win the 1970 Grand National Championship. During the accident, Petty's head hit the track pavement several times, which led NASCAR to mandate the installation of the Petty-developed safety net that covers the driver's side window.</li>
						<li><strong>1971</strong> - Petty won his third Daytona 500, driving a brand-new Plymouth Road Runner and beating Buddy Baker by little more than a car length en route to another historic year, making him the first driver to win the race 3 times. He won 20 more races (which would make him become the first driver to earn more than $1 million in career earnings) and claimed his 3rd Grand National Championship.</li>
						<li><strong>1972</strong> - The last year where Petty would campaign a Plymouth-based race car; in the middle of the year, he debuted to drive a newly built 1972 Dodge Charger in a few races (winning one of them), as he believed that the car would have a slight aero advantage over the Plymouth body style.<br><br>Petty also appeared as himself in the movie <em>43: The Richard Petty Story</em> (a Victory Lane Production, released by Video Gems, distributed by United American Video in 1986).</li>
						<li><strong>1973</strong> - In a driver's duel on February 18, Petty, in a newly built 1973 Dodge Charger (a body style he would use exclusively until the end of 1977), outlasted Baker to win his 4th Daytona 500 after Baker's engine gave out with 6 laps to go.</li>
						<li><strong>1974</strong> - Petty won the Daytona "450" (shortened 50 miles from the normal Daytona 500, due to the energy crisis) for the fifth time, en route to his 5th Winston Cup Championship.</li>
						<li><strong>1975</strong> - Another historic year for Petty, as he won the World 600 for the first time in his career, one of 13 victories en route to his 6th Winston Cup. The 13 victories is a modern (1972–present) NASCAR record for victories in a season, and was tied in 1998 by Jeff Gordon, although Gordon won 13 out of 33 races, compared to Petty's 13 out of 30 races.</li>
						<li><strong>1976</strong> - Petty was involved in one of the most famous finishes in NASCAR history. Petty and David Pearson were racing on the last lap in the Daytona 500. As Petty tried to pass Pearson, at the exit of turn 4, Petty's right rear bumper hit Pearson's left front bumper. Pearson and Petty both spun and hit the front stretch wall. Petty's car came to rest just yards from the finish line, but his engine stalled. Pearson's car had hit the front stretch wall and clipped another car, but his engine was running. Members of Petty's pit crew came out onto the track and tried to push the car to the finish line, but ultimately failed. Pearson was able to drive his car toward the finish line, while Petty's car would not restart. Pearson passed Petty on the infield grass and won the Daytona 500. Petty was given credit for second place.</li>
						<li><strong>1979</strong> - Petty won the Daytona 500 in an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and ran most of the remaining races in a Chevrolet, winning four additional races and taking the NASCAR championship for the seventh, and last, time by 11 points which was the closest points margin in NASCAR history until 1992. Petty also won his sixth Daytona 500, the first to be televised live flag-to-flag; it would become notorious for a fistfight between competitors following the controversial finish. Petty won the race as the first and second place cars of Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough crashed on the last lap. Petty held off Darrell Waltrip and A. J. Foyt. The race is also regarded as being the genesis of the current surge in NASCAR's popularity. The win was part of Petty's seventh and last NASCAR Winston Cup Championship. He was able to hold off Waltrip to win the title in 1979.</li>
						<li><strong>1980</strong> - In a race at Pocono, Petty slammed the Turn 2 wall, nearly flipping the car. Petty barely escaped breaking his neck in the wreck and kept his injury hidden from NASCAR officials for the next races, knowing that another wreck could possibly kill him. Such an incident could never happen today, because of modern NASCAR rules requiring an official series medical liaison to clear a driver after a crash.</li>
						<li><strong>1984</strong> - On July 4, Petty won his 200th (and what would turn to be his final victory) race at the Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway. The race was memorable: On lap 158, Doug Heveron crashed, bringing out the yellow caution flag, essentially turning lap 158 into the last lap as the two drivers battled back to the start-finish line. Petty and Cale Yarborough diced it out on that lap, with Yarborough drafting and taking an early lead before Petty managed to cross the start/finish line only a fender-length ahead. (This is no longer possible because of the 2003 rule change freezing the field immediately upon caution. Furthermore, the green-white-checkered rule was created for if the yellow flag waves with two laps remaining, but not with one lap remaining.) President Ronald Reagan was in attendance, the first sitting president to attend a NASCAR race. Reagan celebrated the milestone with Petty and his family in victory lane.</li>
						<li><strong>1988</strong> - Petty travelled to Australia to help promote a NASCAR exhibition race at the then new Calder Park Thunderdome, the first NASCAR race outside of North America. While he did not compete in the tracks inaugural race, the Goodyear NASCAR 500 (though his son Kyle did), in testing at the 1.119 mi (1.801 km) track which owner Bob Jane had modelled on the Charlotte Motor Speedway, Richard Petty set an unofficial lap record of 28.2 seconds (142.85 mp/h). This would have in fact landed him on pole position for the race as the fastest time in official qualifying was by Alabama Gang member Neil Bonnett who recorded a 28.829-second lap (139.734 mp/h) in his Pontiac Grand Prix.<br><br>In the 1988 Daytona 500, Petty's crash on Lap 106 hurled parts all over the front stretch at the Daytona International Speedway. After several flips, Petty walked away with no serious injuries, except for temporary sight loss due to excessive G-forces. The crash was similar to the accident suffered by Bobby Allison during the 1987 Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway and Carl Edwards 2009 Talladega crash in that all three cars became airborne after turning sideways, and both cars damaged the spectator fencing (though Petty's crash did much less damage to the fencing). Petty's car became airborne despite the use of the carburetor restrictor plate, which was mandated by NASCAR for races at Talladega Superspeedway and Daytona International Speedway just prior to the start of the 1988 season.</li>
						<li><strong>1989</strong> - Petty appeared as himself in the movie <em>Speed Zone</em>, driving in his famous blue No. 43 car.</li>
						<li><strong>1990</strong> - Petty appeared in the Tom Cruise movie <em>Days of Thunder</em>.</li>
						<li><strong>1991</strong> - On October 1, Petty announced he would retire after the 1992 season.</li>
						<li><strong>1992</strong> - Petty chose to run the entire 1992 season, not just selected events as other drivers have done before retirement. His year-long Fan Appreciation Tour took him around the country, participating in special events, awards ceremonies, and fan-related meetings. Racing Champions ran a promotional line of diecast cars for every race in Petty's Farewell Tour. In his final year behind the wheel, he had two notable races.<br><br>At the 1992 Pepsi 400 on July 4, Petty qualified second. Before the start of the race, he was honored with a gift ceremony which included a visit from President George H. W. Bush.<br><br>On his final visit to each track, Petty would lead the field on the pace lap to salute the fans. Petty's final race was the season-ending Hooters 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The race was notable in that it was the first career start for Jeff Gordon, and it was the second closest points championship in NASCAR history, with six drivers mathematically eligible to win the championship. A record 160,000 spectators attended the race, which went down to the final lap with Bill Elliott winning the race, and Alan Kulwicki winning the championship by 10 points over Elliott after Davey Allison dropped out early after a crash.<br><br>Facing the intense pressure, Petty barely managed to qualify at Atlanta, posting the 39th fastest speed out of 41 cars. He would not have been eligible for the provisional starting position, and had to qualify on speed.<br><br>On the 94th lap, Petty became tangled up in an accident, and his car caught fire. Petty pulled the car off the track, and climbed out of the burning machine uninjured. His pit crew worked diligently with less than 20 laps to go to get the car running again, and with two laps to go, Petty pulled out of the pits and was credited as running at the finish in his final race. He took his final checkered flag finishing in 35th position. After the race, Petty circled the track to salute the fans one final time in his trademark STP Pontiac.<br><br>And finally, Petty was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President George Bush in 1992, the first motorsports athlete ever to be honored with this award.</li>
						<li><strong>1993</strong> - Petty got back into a race car one more time. On August 18, NASCAR participated in a tire test at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, in preparations for the 1994 Brickyard 400. Petty drove several laps around the track, and then donated his car to the Speedway's museum.<br><br>Petty also purchased a ranch in the Bridger-Teton National Forrest, just south of Jackson. Fittingly, The King's 90-acre compound is called &quot;Winner's Retreat&quot;.</li>
						<li><strong>1997</strong> - Petty was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.</li>
						<li><strong>1998</strong> - Petty was named one of NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998.</li>
						<li><strong>2003</strong> - Petty would again step into a race car in 2003 on the week of the final race under the Winston banner at Homestead-Miami Speedway and took a solo lap honoring his seven Winston Cup Championships for Winston's salute to the champions.</li>
						<li><strong>2006</strong> - Petty was cast in the Pixar film <em>Cars</em>. He voiced the character Strip Weathers, also known as &quot;The King.&quot; His car, the Road Runner Superbird with the distinctive &quot;Petty Blue&quot; tint and the number 43, is also the model used for the car in the movie. The King's accident at the end of the film was also a re-creation of Petty's real-life Daytona 500 accident in 1988 with the exception that it was not caused by a deliberate crash. The bit in which Lightning McQueen assists him to the finish line is based on the 1976 incident, albeit by the pit crew. Petty's wife Lynda also had a voice role in the film, as &quot;Mrs. The King,&quot; a 1976 Chrysler Town & Country station-wagon (based on Petty's family car).<br><br>Petty's character did not appear in <em>Cars 2</em> (2011), but did return in <em>Cars 3</em> (2017), in which Petty voiced his character again, this time as the crew chief of his nephew and new Dinoco racer Hank/Cal Weathers, who was voiced by his son, driver Kyle Petty.</li>
						<li><strong>2008</strong> - He appeared as himself in the movie <em>Swing Vote</em> driving in his famous blue No. 43 car, and letting the main character drive his car to Air Force One to meet the President.</li>
						<li><strong>2009</strong> - At the Coke Zero 400 in Daytona, for the 25th anniversary of his final, 200th victory in 1984, Petty was behind the wheel of one of his 1980s Pontiac racecars during the pace laps, leading the field for the first pace lap. The field split him and he followed behind the field for one more pace lap before he pulled it in.</li>
						<li><strong>2010</strong> - Petty was inducted into the first class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame on May 23.<br><br>Petty also appeared in <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mczdJenc07A" target="_blank">Petty Blue</a></em>, a documentary by NASCAR about him, which was narrated by Kevin Costner.</li>
						<li><strong>2011</strong> - In May, Petty was chosen to be the Grand Marshal for the 2011 STP 400 of the Sprint Cup Series.<br><br>He was also featured in the show Modern HotrodZ. Petty's Garage now builds Custom cars for the general public, most of which are Limited Edition.</li>
						<li><strong>2014</strong> - Petty's wife Lynda died after a long battle with cancer.</li>
